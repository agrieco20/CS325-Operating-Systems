This BASH Shell Script (Ubunutu Linux) determines whether files in the same directory as this program have a file type that corresponds to that of a Java (Compiler: javac), C++ (Compiler: g++), or C (Compiler: gcc) file. Every file of any of these types that this script finds in the given directory will be compiled and then the names of those files will be outputted to a file named "comp_out.txt" along with the compiler that was used to process the original file. Any error output will be placed in a file named "comp_err.txt".
