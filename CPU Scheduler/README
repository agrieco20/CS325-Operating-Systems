Project Description: This project serves as a gatekeeper in order to ensure that active processes currently being processed by the SAC-SimOS are scheduled so that the average job will be waiting in the queue for the shortest amount of time possible. This specific implementation is an adaptation of the "Shortest Job First" method only it is written so that it will preemptively switch between active processes and prioritize processing jobs that have the shortest estimated completion time first.
