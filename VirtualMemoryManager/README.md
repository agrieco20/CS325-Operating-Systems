**Project Description:** The entirety of this project simulates a single core Operating System. My specific assignment was to build a Virtual Memory Manager that was to facilitate when different process pages were to be assigned to a given frame. I was able to accomplish this by implementing a "Least Recently Used" Victim Selection Algorithm.

**Main File that I Wrote Responsible for Resource Management:** "src/com/sos/os/VirtualMemoryManager.java"

**Additional Files I Wrote in order to Support my Scheduler:** "src/com/sos/os/FrameTracker.java"
