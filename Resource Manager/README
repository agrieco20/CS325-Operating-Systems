**Project Description:** The entirety of this project simulates a single core Operating System. My specific assignment was to build a Resource Manager that was to facilitate when certain resources were available and could therefore be accessed by processes looking to use them so that they could finish being processed by SAC-SimOS. I was able to accomplish this by assigning each resource a Mutex Lock to ensure only one process could access a resource at a time.

**Main File that I Wrote Responsible for Resource Management:** "src/com/sos/os/ResourceManager.java"

**Additional Files I Wrote in order to Support my Scheduler:** "src/com/sos/os/mutexLock.java"
